        "*   Non-standard patterns like the character '﻿' and excessive whitespace were found and removed from the 'Text' column.\n",
        "*   The 'Category' column contains 43 unique values, with a varying distribution across categories, indicating potential class imbalance (e.g., 'Accountant' with 151 occurrences vs. 'React Developer' with 18 occurrences).\n",
        "*   The 'Text' column was cleaned by converting to lowercase, removing punctuation and special characters, and standardizing whitespace.\n",
        "*   The cleaned text was transformed into a numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization, resulting in a matrix of shape (3411, 5000).\n",
        "*   Two new numerical features, 'text\\_length' and 'word\\_count', were engineered from the cleaned text.\n",
        "*   The numerical features 'text\\_length' (range 52 to 5939) and 'word\\_count' (range 7 to 740) have different scales and distributions.\n",
        "*   There is potential class imbalance in the 'Category' column, which might require specific handling for classification tasks.\n",

        "*   Given the class imbalance in the target variable ('Category') and the differences in scale for numerical features, further preprocessing steps like handling imbalance (e.g., oversampling, undersampling) and feature scaling (e.g., standardization, normalization) should be considered before training a machine learning model, especially for models sensitive to these issues.\n",
        "*   The dataset is largely prepared for training a text classification model, but the identified issues (class imbalance, feature scaling) require attention. The next crucial step is to split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance accurately.\n"
